### Harassment

Let's talk about the harassment I did and didn't face. It's an interesting look at intersectional identities in philosophy of physics. I talked about women's experiences above, because there weren't any non-white philosophers of physics I knew, besides myself. So I couldn't observe how they coped with the environment. But here's my experience. I benefitted, I think, from being a masculine-presenting woman at the time. And possibly, also from being Asian and having the Asians=good at math stereotype balance out the women=bad at math stereotype.

What benefits? Well, for one, I didn't get harassed the way other more feminine women were. Even the serial harasser who hit on 5-6 grad students left me alone. I did still get called 'sweetie' sometimes.

I did get harassed for my national origin. I had a traumatic upbringing in a police state and spent most of my childhood wishing I hadn't existed. I was not allowed to express my own opinions, as they were Not Authorized, or to dress in a gender non-conforming way. I had abuse parents who parroted state propaganda back at me. Well, too bad for me, because one of the first things I had to deal with in grad school was having a famous philosopher of physics wax lyrical to me about my home country, which he had never visited, and spam my mailbox with news cuttings from right-wing publications, with the bits talking up my home country highlighted. He also explicitly said to me, in the context of that country's stock market bouncing back quickly from the Great Recession and my pointing out that it didn't help the people of that country, that he cared about corporations not people. Every department gathering was an event where I had to grit my teeth and deal with this famous guy, whom I didn't want to offend, telling my stuff about my home country that's false and that's dismissive of my own traumatic experience growing up in it.

I started avoiding this person. Everyone who had him on their committee got fancy jobs. I did not seek him out for that, though I'm sure he would have agreed and I worked in an area he was expert in. I kept my distance. I was probably compared unfavorably with other candidates who had a letter from him. They were all cis white men.

### Doing the right thing

So much of how academia works involves avoiding doing the right thing. Avoiding, for example, reporting someone for harassment when you're on the job market. I did that twice.

There's anti-retaliation policies against reporting someone for harassment. Those policies are laughable for those who are on the market. The people I was reporting could have said anything they wanted about me to their friends, who were on hiring committees, and there would be no way to know that that's why I didn't get a job.

These people are still in philosophy. They have powerful friends who defend them.
