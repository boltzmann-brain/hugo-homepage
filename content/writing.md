Here are some links to writing samples from my previous roles in software documentation. For my academic writing, see [Papers](/papers).

I can also provide writing samples that aren't publicly available upon request.

## Messagebird writing samples

These tutorials for sample Flask/Python apps demo-ing a REST API are from a freelance gig I had a few years ago. I wrote both the sample apps and the tutorials.

## Laserfiche writing samples

I wrote most of the topics under [Customizing a Classic Form with CSS and Javascript](https://doc.laserfiche.com/laserfiche.documentation/en-us/Default.htm#../Subsystems/ProcessAutomation/Content/Forms-Current/Javascript-and-CSS/Customizing%20a%20Form%20with%20CSS%20and%20Javascript.htm%3FTocPath%3DProcess%2520Automation%7CBusiness%2520Processes%7CCreating%2520a%2520New%2520Form%7CCustomizing%2520a%2520Classic%2520Form%2520with%2520CSS%2520and%2520Javascript%7C_____0).
