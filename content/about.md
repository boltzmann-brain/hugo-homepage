I'm a data scientist who does interdisciplinary [research](/papers) and education on responsible AI, currently based in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Prior to this, I was a technical writer for a variety of software products, ranging from MLOps to REST APIs to complicated enterprise GUIs. An even longer time ago, I got a PhD in philosophy after stints in computer vision and physics. You can contact me at [my first name]@fastmail.com.
