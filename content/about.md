I'm a data scientist who does interdisciplinary [research](/papers) on responsible AI and helps data science teams make their models more explainable. Prior to this, I was a technical writer for a variety of software products, ranging from MLOps to REST APIs to complicated enterprise GUIs. An even longer time ago, I got a PhD in philosophy after stints in computer vision and physics. My research has won best paper awards at both [FAccT](https://twitter.com/FAccTConference/status/1369315183143903237?s=20) and the [Philosophy of Science Association](https://philsci.org/ernest_nagel_early-career_scho.php).

I'm currently based in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and you can contact me at [my first name]@fastmail.com.
